It has a very simple feature to Ask Questions about 3 different documents data [already extracted!]
The data is limited to get the answers faster as the model used for question answer feature has a limit of about 512 tokens at a time and for the purpose of increasing accuracy I have managed to get it to 2000 tokens at a time. But yes the time to process has increase too. The good news is that it is still in seconds.

You can ask for example:
  Give me the dates discussed!
  What are the Business names?
  etc..
  
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Make sure to run the backend first!
